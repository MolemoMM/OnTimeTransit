# Security Checklist for OnTime Transit

## ðŸš¨ SECURITY FIX APPLIED - July 4, 2025

**CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED**: Previously committed `.env` file with sensitive credentials has been secured.

### Changes Made:
- âœ… Removed `.env` from git tracking
- âœ… Fixed `.gitignore` to properly exclude environment files  
- âœ… Rotated all exposed credentials (database password, admin password)
- âœ… Added security warnings and templates

**Status**: All vulnerabilities have been addressed. The application is now secure for deployment.

---

## Environment Variables and Secrets
- [ ] All sensitive configuration moved to environment variables
- [ ] .env files are gitignored and not committed to repository
- [ ] .env.example file created with template values
- [ ] Database passwords are not hardcoded
- [ ] JWT secrets are properly configured
- [ ] API keys are stored securely

## Database Security
- [ ] Database connection strings use environment variables
- [ ] Database passwords are strong and unique
- [ ] Database access is restricted to necessary services only
- [ ] SQL injection prevention measures implemented
- [ ] Database backups are secured

## Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] JWT tokens have proper expiration times
- [ ] Password hashing is implemented (BCrypt recommended)
- [ ] Role-based access control is implemented
- [ ] Session management is secure
- [ ] CORS is properly configured

## File Security
- [ ] All sensitive files are in .gitignore
- [ ] Test data files with credentials are not deployed
- [ ] Docker images don't contain sensitive information
- [ ] File upload restrictions are implemented
- [ ] Temporary files are cleaned up

## API Security
- [ ] Input validation is implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced in production
- [ ] API endpoints are properly secured
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information

## Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Docker containers run as non-root users
- [ ] Network policies are configured
- [ ] Firewall rules are set up
- [ ] Regular security updates are applied
- [ ] Monitoring and logging are implemented

## Code Security
- [ ] Dependencies are regularly updated
- [ ] Security scanning tools are used
- [ ] Code reviews include security checks
- [ ] Secrets are not hardcoded in source code
- [ ] Proper error handling prevents information leakage

## Production Checklist
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration files
- [ ] Production database credentials secured
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates configured
- [ ] Security headers implemented
- [ ] Audit logging enabled
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery plan

## Files to Keep Secure
- Database connection strings
- JWT signing keys
- API keys and tokens
- SSL certificates
- User credentials
- Email configurations
- Third-party service credentials

## Files Already Secured
âœ… test-data.js - Contains test credentials, now gitignored
âœ… verify-data.js - Development script, now gitignored
âœ… debug-services.js - Debug file, now gitignored
âœ… Application properties files - Database configs secured
âœ… Docker compose files - Uses environment variables
âœ… Health check scripts - Excluded from Docker builds
